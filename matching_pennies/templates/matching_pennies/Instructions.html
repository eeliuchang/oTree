        Instructions for Part I
    </h3>

    <p>
        In the first part of the experiment, your task is to reproduce the outcomes of 100 flips of a fair coin.
    </p>

    <p>
    By pure chance, some of these coin flips would come up heads (H) while others would come up tails (T). Sometimes the coin will show two heads in a row (HH), while at other times it will be two tails (TT), or heads and then tails (HT), etc. Generally speaking, knowing the outcome of one coin flip should not aid in predicting the outcome of the next one.
    </p>

    <p>
        On the next screen, you are being asked to enter a sequence of the letters “H” and “T” that mimics 100 repeated flips of a fair coin as closely as possible. Your payoff will depend on how random the sequence appears to be, according to a statistical test.
    </p>

    <p>
        For instance, if the test determines that there is a 15% probability that the sequence was produced by flips of a fair coin, then you will earn 15 lottery tickets. Similarly, if the probability is determined to be 20%, then you will earn 20 tickets, whereas you would receive 30 tickets if the statistical test determined that your sequence corresponds to random coin flips with a 30% probability, and so on. In this part of the experiment, you can thus earn up to 100 lottery tickets.
